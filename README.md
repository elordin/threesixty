### Visualization request

The most common call uses `"type": "visualization"`. It is used to request a visualization with certain parameters.

```json
{
    "type": "visualization"
    "data": [ ],
    "visualization": { },
    "processor": [ ]
}
```

#### Parameters

- __data__ _required_: A list of ids (Strings) of datasets which will be used for the visualization.
- __visualization__ _optional_: Specifies the desired visualization format. Is deduced when omitted.
- __processor__ _optional_: A list of processing steps applied to the input data. Is deduced when omitted.

##### `visualization`
JSON object with the two keys `type` and `args`.

```
{
    "type": "FooVisualization",
    "args": { }
}
```

- __type__ _required_: Name of the visualization
- __args__ _required_: Object containing visualization specific parameters.

`args` always requires a `"width"` and a `"height"`.

For specific details name and args of individual visualizations, see their usage info.

##### `processor`
List of JSON objects, each describing a single step in the processing pipeline.

A definition of a processing step contains the `method`, i.e. its name, and `args`.

```json
{
    "method": "FooProcessingMethod",
    "args": { }
}
```

`args` always requires an `idMapping`. And ID-mapping specifies what datasets are processed and the IDs assigned to them after they are processed.

```json
{
    "idMapping": {
        "Foo": "FooProcessed",
        "Bar": "Bar"
    }
}
```

In the above example, the two sets "Foo" and "Bar" are processed.

The result of processing "Foo" is stored as "FooProcessed" and can be accessed that way later on.
Additionally, the original "Foo" can also still be accessed.

"Bar" on the other hand is overwritten with the result of the processing method.
Processing methods, or the visualization, accessing "Bar" later on, will receive the processed data.
The unprocessed data is no longer accessible.


Additional parameters may be required depending on the processing method.
See their specific usage info for details.

### Help requests

Calling the engine with just `"type": "help"` returns a general usage message.

```
{
    "type": "help"
}
```

Additionally specifying `"for"` gives usage messages for specific parts.

```json
{
    "type": "help",
    "for": "visualizations"
}
```

`visualizations` lists available visualizations.

```json
{
    "type": "help",
    "for": "processingmethods"
}
```

`processingmethods` lists available processing methods.


Using the name of a visualization or a processing method as returned by the two calls above, displays usage information for that specific visualization or processing method.


```json
{
    "type": "help",
    "for": "data"
}
```

`data` lists help on how to insert data.
