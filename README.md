### Visualization request

The most common call uses `"type": "visualization"`. It is used to request a visualization with certain parameters.

```json
{
    "type": "visualization",
    "data": [ ],
    "visualization": { },
    "processor": [ ]
}
```

#### Parameters

- __data__ _required_: A list of ids (Strings) of datasets which will be used for the visualization.
- __visualization__ _optional_: Specifies the desired visualization format. Is deduced when omitted.
- __processor__ _optional_: A list of processing steps applied to the input data. Is deduced when omitted.

##### `visualization`
JSON object with the two keys `type` and `args`.

```
{
    "type": "FooVisualization",
    "args": { }
}
```

- __type__ _required_: Name of the visualization
- __args__ _required_: Object containing visualization specific parameters.

`args` always requires a `width` and a `height`.

For specific details on _name_ and _args_ of individual visualizations, see their usage info.


##### `processor`
List of JSON objects, each describing a single step in the processing pipeline.

A definition of a processing step contains the `method`, i.e. its name, and `args`.

```json
{
    "method": "FooProcessingMethod",
    "args": { }
}
```

`args` always requires an `idMapping`. And ID-mapping specifies what datasets are processed and the IDs assigned to them after they are processed.

```json
{
    "idMapping": {
        "Foo": "FooProcessed",
        "Bar": "Bar"
    }
}
```

In the above example, the two sets with IDs __"Foo"__ and __"Bar"__ are processed.

The result of processing __"Foo"__ is stored as __"FooProcessed"__ and can be accessed that way later on.
Additionally, the original "Foo" can also still be accessed.

__"Bar"__ on the other hand is overwritten with the result of the processing method.
Other processing methods - or the visualization - accessing __"Bar"__ later on, will receive the processed data.
_The unprocessed data is no longer accessible_.


Additional parameters may be required depending on the processing method.
See their specific usage info for details.


### Help requests / usage info

Calling the engine with just `"type": "help"` returns a general usage message.

```
{
    "type": "help"
}
```

Additionally specifying `"for"` gives usage messages for specific parts.

```json
{
    "type": "help",
    "for": "visualizations"
}
```

`visualizations` lists available visualizations.

```json
{
    "type": "help",
    "for": "processingmethods"
}
```

`processingmethods` lists available processing methods.


Using the name of a visualization or a processing method as returned by the two calls above, displays usage information for that specific visualization or processing method.


```json
{
    "type": "help",
    "for": "data"
}
```

`data` lists help on how to insert data.
